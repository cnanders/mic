function purge()

    % Purges the workspace of all variables, classes, timers, etc.



    % close all executes the 'CloseRequestFunction' of every window that has a
    % visible handle.

    % This order is important because it deletes any open windows that have a
    % visible handle, before deleting the reference to the objects that created
    % the windows. If you call clear first, you delete reference to the object
    % that created the open window but the open window stays open and now you
    % have a window that points to nothing which crashes MATLAB when you try to
    % interact with the window.

    % Whenever you run clear on a class instance, it calls the destructor (if
    % defined) BUT only when there are no outstanding references to the object
    % (like open windows, etc).  To define a destructor, define a delete()
    % method in the class

    % Loop through workspace variables and call delete on each one that is an
    % object.

    % You may be tempted to make a class or a method of Utils that executes
    % this code but it will not work.  The problem is that "who" only has
    % access to the variables within scope of where it is called from.  If it
    % is called from within a class method, it only has access to the class
    % variables.
