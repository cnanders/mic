    PROBLEM DESCRIPTION (NEVER DELETE THIS DISCUSSION)
    
    When building Clock, we found out that adding / removing tasks was
    slow.  Upon investigation we realized why.  For adding, we had to push
    an additional function handle to the cell array of function handles
    (ceTaskFcn).  When the cell didn't have enough memory allocated to
    store the additional function handle, Matlab would (behind the scenes)
    create an entire new cell allocated with just enough memory and then
    delete the old cell.  This 'create a new one with more memory and
    delete the old one' took lots of time, and the time increased as the
    number of items in the cell increased.  For example, adding the 50th
    task would take 300 ms (!!)
    
    Oddly enough, this super long assignment does not happen when the cell
    is not a property of a handle class.  For example, the code below which
    copies this.ceTaskFcn to a local variable and pushes a new function
    handle to the cell is blazing fast and the execution time is not
    dependent on the number of itesm in this.ceTaskFcn (I only tested up to
    60 items, but there was no difference in execution time as the number
    of items in this.ceTaskFcn increased)
    
    // Code
    tic;
    ceTaskFcn = this.ceTaskFcn;
    toc;

    this.msg('append new fh to copy');
    tic;
    ceTaskFcn{dCount} = fhTmp;
    toc;
    
    // Output
    copy this.ceTaskFcn
    Elapsed time is 0.000017 seconds.
    append new fh to copy
    Elapsed time is 0.000081 seconds.
    
    
    This means there is definitely additional overhead involved with
    dealing with cell arrays of function handles as properties of a handle
    class, specifically with assignment to the cell and deletion of items
    in the cell (I explain the delete issue below)
    
    
    On the delete side, something similar happened but I don't think it had
    to do with memory, per-se.  When I remove a task I would do a
    this.ceTaskFcn(lItems) = []; to purge those items from the cell.
    Deleting an item that is not at the end required a rearrangement of the
    indicies of many of the items in the cell and this was also slow.  I'm
    not sure if matlab does the delete, and create new thing here as well
    but this was a slow process.  With 30 HardwareIO instances (roughly 30
    tasks), doing a remove took took about 92 ms to remove the function
    handle from the cell as shown below.  As a rule, removing a
    function_handle takes very long, removing a char takes 100s of us,
    and removing a double takes 30 us
    
    this.ceTaskFcn(lItems) = []
    Elapsed time is 0.096125 seconds.
    this.ceTaskName(lItems) = []
    Elapsed time is 0.000117 seconds.
    this.ceTaskPeriod(lItems) = []
    Elapsed time is 0.000030 seconds.
    
    With twice the number of the items in the cell (60 HardwareIO instances
    built as compared to 30 before), it takes twice as long to remove a
    function_handle from the cell but removing the double and char still
    takes the same length of time
    
    this.ceTaskFcn(lItems) = []
    Elapsed time is 0.179634 seconds.
    this.ceTaskName(lItems) = []
    Elapsed time is 0.000054 seconds.
    this.ceTaskPeriod(lItems) = []
    Elapsed time is 0.000027 seconds.
    
    
    SOLUTIONS
    
    The solution to the "add" problem is to pre-allocate ceTaskFcn with a
    enough memory that whenever we add a task to it, there is enough memory
    allocated that it never does the 'delete + create new' process in the
    background.
    
    Unfortunately, there is not a good way to pre-allocate memory to the
    cell array, other than filling it with actual function_handle
    instances.  This really sucks and could be bad news for our list of
    tasks since now ceTaskFcn would have a bunch of 'fake' function_handles
    in it and each clock cycle they would exeucte.  Luckily the way I
    structured things makes this problem go away.

    I use:
    (cefh == cell of function_handle)
    (ced == cell of double)
    (cec == cell of char)
    
    cell (1 x m) of functional_handle to store the function_handle of each task
    cell (1 x m) of char to store the name of each task
    double (1 x m) to store the period of each task

    
    if I don't push an item to the period or name cells when I pre-allocate
    items to cefh, then I can use ced and cec to search for tasks that need
    to be executed, rather than looking through cefh
    
    To make the delete process fast, I'm going to store a fourth piece of
    information:
    
    logical (1 x m) to store if a particular task is active.  The idea here
    is that removing a task just means setting lTaskActive(index) = false.
    This doesn't actually purge the task from dTaskPeriod or ceTaskFcn, it
    just says that if index = find(lTaskActive == false), then
    dTaskPeriod(index) and ceTaskFcn(index) can be overwritten with new
    tasks.  This is similar to how things are deleted in a hard drive - the
    bits are not re-set to zero, there is just a pointer that says "hey
    the bits at these addresses are free to be overwritten if needed". 
 
    When I add a task, I will first check to see if there any available
    spaces to put the new task.  If not, it will be appended to the end of
    the list
    
    This means that at any time ceTaskFcn, dTaskPeriod, and ceTaskName will
    contain tasks that are not active anymore.  This is nothing wrong with
    this, we just need to be aware of it.  
    
    With these strategies, Clock can be blazing fast becauase we will
    never need to increase the memory allocated to ceTaskFcn or re-arrange
    the items in ceTaskFcn (memory/time intensive).
